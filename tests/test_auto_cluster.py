"""`cluster=auto` picks in-process or a cluster, and agrees either way.

It scans in this process first and compares the aggregated Arrow payloads
against ``cluster.max_bytes``. Under budget, the scan already in hand is used
and no cluster is ever built. Over it, the payloads are dropped, a
``LocalCluster`` is started, and the read is redone across its workers.

Two failure modes are easy to miss and are covered here:

* the analyzer resolving its own client instead of adopting the one the
  entrypoint built. That still *works* -- it gets a `NullClient` -- but it
  cannot promote, so `cluster=auto` silently degrades to `cluster=none` and
  every trace is analysed in process no matter how large.
* the escalation path never being exercised, since no bundled fixture comes
  close to the default budget. `cluster.max_bytes` is forced down to trigger it.
